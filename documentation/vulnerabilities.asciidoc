= Vulnerabilities

We support you with automatic downloads and "installations" of arbitrary software.
However, security is also very important, and therefore we implemented various security features like e.g. verification of checksums (SHA-256) of downloaded files from a different source to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
Also, a tool version that you want to use for your project may have severe https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/[vulnerabilities].
Therefore, we maintain a list of known https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures[CVEs] for the tools we support. Take a look at the `_ide/urls/«tool»/«edition»/security.json` file.
In case you are reading this page, you most probably got a security warning because you are using a vulnerable software.
In that case your attention and action is required, and you should consider an update as soon as possible and follow the suggestions prompted by IDEasy.

Please note that if you are using the vulnerable tool on your own behalf you alone are responsible (e.g. for central tools like `git` or tools that you did setup by yourself via our IDE product).
However, in case you are team-mate of a project and did not choose the tool and its version yourself, you should first run `update` to ensure you have the latest settings and tool versions.
If that already fixes the security warnings, you are done.
Otherwise, contact your IDE-admin, who is responsible for maintaining your settings git repository.
NOTE: You can find it in the `settings` folder of your IDE installation next to the `workspaces` folder.
You may open a shell in this settings folder and call `git remote -v` to figure out the git URL and navigate there to find our your IDE-admin.

Please note that for each tool that is setup via our IDE product, you can call `set-version «tool» latest` to configure it to the latest version.
Also note that you can use the asterisk in a tool version.
So e.g. if you do `set-version java  17*` you will configure to always get the latest `17.x` version of `java`.
Further, do not forget to call `install «tool»` after you have configured a new version to actually install the update.
If you are an IDE admin you then should test your changes and after some QA process push them to the settings git repo.
After that, instruct your team to run `update` so all developers get the updates automatically and the vulnerabilities are gone for your team.
Thank you for caring about IT security and keeping us safe!!!

== Git

Git is a link:setup.asciidoc#prerequisites[prerequisite] of our IDE product and therefore not managed by it.
In other words: You have installed Git on your machine, and you alone are responsible for installing updates.
To update your git client simply go to https://git-scm.com/downloads[git downloads] and download the latest version for your operating system and run the installer.
This will automatically update your existing installation.
For security consider the philosophy of "latest is greatest".
Git also does a great job in keeping downward compatible so newer versions typically are better and more secure.

You can find CVEs for git https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-4008/GIT.html[here].
Please be aware that CVEs like https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2022-25648/[CVE-2022-25648] can allow remote code execution and therefore have to be fixed urgently.

== Maven

CVEs for maven can be found https://maven.apache.org/security.html[here].
Maven is not always downward compatible.
Therefore, when changing the major or minor version, please do according testing and QA before pushing changes to your team.
